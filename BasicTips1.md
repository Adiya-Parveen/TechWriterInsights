#Tips 

Always remember that writing is a craft, not an art. You must never runaway from your craft,
simply because you are lacking inspiration. As a professional writer, you must establish a 
daily routine of writing and stick to it. If you want to write as a professional, you need to
write every single day, just like any other job.

Don't ask other writers for a "perfect" or "right" method to write, because there isn't. There 
are all kinds of writers and all kind of methods, and any method that helps you to say what you 
want to say is the right method for you.
