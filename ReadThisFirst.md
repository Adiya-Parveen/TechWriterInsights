# Read This Before Deciding on a Career in Technical Writing

Before starting anything new, it is normal to ask for experienced person's adivce. But 
don't ask other writers for a "perfect" or "right" method to write, because there isn't 
one. There are all kinds of writers and all kind of methods, and any method that helps 
you to say what you want to say is the right method for you.

I sought advice from several seasoned writers, asking for guidance on what steps to 
take and how to approach the situation, and the one thing that was constant in everyone's 
answer was that I should always remember that writing is a craft, not an art. I must 
never runaway from my craft, simply because I am lacking inspiration. And as a 
professional writer, I must establish a daily routine of writing and stick to it. 
So the second advice would be if you want to write as a professional, you need to write 
every single day, just like any other job.
