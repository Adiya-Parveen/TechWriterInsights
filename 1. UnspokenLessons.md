# Rewrite

Now, for the lessons that I learned through my experience and something that no one tells
you as it should come naturally to a teachnical writer, and it will come naturally after 
rewriting your document 4 or 5 times. 

With each rewrite you will learn to strip every sentence to its cleanest components. And 
remove every word that serves no function, every long word that could be a short word, 
every adverb that carries the same meaning that is already in the verb, every passive 
construction that leaves the reader unsure of who is doing what - the thousand and one 
adulterants  that weaken the strength of a sentence, you will learn to backspace them and
will try to always simplify.

While rewritting examine every word you put in your document. You will find a surprising 
number that don't serve any purpose. Always ask yourself questions such as, is every 
word doing any new work? Can any thought be expressed with more economy? Is anything 
pompous or pretentious or faddish? Am I hanging on something useless just because I 
think it's beautiful?. Asking these questions will help you to simplify and declutter 
your document.

This rewriting and removing will make your document tighter, stronger, more precise, 
and will eliminate every element that's not doing useful work. 

Another tip to detect the unwanted clutter is to ask yourself What am I trying to say?
Then look at what you have written and ask, Have I said it? Is it clear to someone 
encountering the subject for the first time? Does my document misleads or overshare 
or doesn't deliver what it was supposed to?. Always know the WHY and WHAT of your 
document, this will keep your thinking clear and clear thinking becomes clear writing.
