# Lesson 1

## Writing Guidance 101: Embrace Your Own Method and Daily Practice

Before starting anything new, it is normal to ask for experienced person's adivce. But 
don't ask other writers for a "perfect" or a "right" method to write, because there isn't 
one. There are all kinds of writers and all kind of methods, and any method that helps 
you to say what you want to say is the right method for you.

I sought advice from several seasoned writers, asking for guidance on what steps to take 
and how to approach the situation, and the one thing that was constant in everyone's 
answer was that I should always remember that writing is a craft, not an art. I must 
never runaway from my craft, simply because I am lacking inspiration. And as a 
professional writer, I must establish a daily routine of writing and stick to it. 
So the second advice would be if you want to write as a professional, you need to write 
every single day, just like any other job.

## Rewrite

Now, for the lessons that I learned through my experience and something that no one tells
you as it should come naturally to a teachnical writer, and it will come naturally after 
rewriting your document 4 or 5 times. 

With each rewrite you will learn to strip every sentence to its cleanest components. And 
remove every word that serves no function, every long word that could be a short word, 
every adverb that carries the same meaning that is already in the verb, every passive 
construction that leaves the reader unsure of who is doing what - the thousand and one 
adulterants  that weaken the strength of a sentence, you will learn to backspace them and
will try to always simplify.

While rewritting examine every word you put in your document. You will find a surprising 
number that don't serve any purpose. Always ask yourself questions such as, is every 
word doing any new work? Can any thought be expressed with more economy? Is anything 
pompous or pretentious or faddish? Am I hanging on something useless just because I 
think it's beautiful? Asking these questions will help you to simplify and declutter 
your document.

This rewriting and removing will make your document tighter, stronger, more precise, 
and will eliminate every element that's not doing useful work. 

Another tip to detect the unwanted clutter is to ask yourself What am I trying to say?
Then look at what you have written and ask, Have I said it? Is it clear to someone 
encountering the subject for the first time? Does my document misleads or overshare 
or doesn't deliver what it was supposed to?. Always know the WHY and WHAT of your 
document, this will keep your thinking clear and clear thinking becomes clear writing.

## the Audience

"Who am I writing for?" You are writing for yourself. Don't try to visualize the great
mass audience. There is no such audience - every reader is a different person. Don't
try to guess what sort of thing editors want to publish or what you think the country
is in a mood to read. 

In terms of craft, there's no excuse for losing readers through sloppy workmanship.
If they doze off in the middle of your article because you have been careless about
a technical detail, the fault is yours. But on the larger issue of whether the reader
likes you, or likes what you are saying or how you are saying it, or agrees with it,
or feels an affinity for your sense of humor or your vision of life, don't give him
a moment's worry. You are who you are, he is who he is, and either you'll get along or
you won't. 

Work hard to master the tools. Simplify, prune and strive for order. Think of this as
a mechanical act, and soon your sentences will become cleaner. The act will never 
become as mechanical as, say, shampooing or brushing, you will always have to think about
the various ways in which the tools can be used. But at least your sentences will be 
grounded in solid principles, and your chances of losing the reader will be smaller. 

Never say anything in writing that you wouldn't comfortably say in conversation. If you
are not a person who says "indeed" or "moreover", or who calls someone an individual
("He is a fine individual"). Please don't write it. 

The race in writing is not to the swift but to the original. Make a habit of reading
what is being written today and what was written by earlier masters. Writing is learned by
imitation. If anyone asked me how I learned to write, I'd say I learned by reading the men
and women who were doing the kind of writing I wanted to do and trying to figure out how
they did it. 

Get in the habit of using dictionaries and thesaurus. For example look up "villain",
and you will be awash in such rascality as only a lexicographer could conjure back from
centuries of iniqaity, obliquity, depravity, knavery, profligacy, frailty, flagrancy,
infamy, immorality, corruption, wickedness, wrongdoing, backsliding, and sin. You will
find ruffians and riffraff, miscreants, and malefactors, reprobates, and rapscallions,
hooligans and hoodlums, scamps and scapegraces, scoundrels and scalawags, jezebels and 
jades. You'll find adjectives to fit them all (foul and fiendish, devilish and diabolical),
and adverbs and verbs to describe how the wrongdoers do their wrong, and cross-references
leading to still other thickets of venality and vice. 

Also bear in mind, when you're choosing words and stringing them together, how they
sound. This may seem absurd: readers read with their eyes. But in fact they have hear
what they are reading far more than you realize. 

Remember that words are the only tools you've got. Learn to use them with originality
and care. And also remember: some body out there is listening. 

All writing is ultimately a question of solving a problem. It maybe a problem of where to 
obtain the facts or how to organize the material. It may be a problem of approach or attitude,
tone or style. Whatever it is, it has to be confronted and solved. 

Decide what corner of your subject you're going to bite off, and be content to cover it 
well and stop. As for what point you want to make, every successful piece of nonfiction
should leave the reader with one provocative thought that he or she didn't have before.
Not two thoughts, or five; just one. 

Before writing, deciding on unities is crucial as they anchor good writing and keep the 
reader engaged. Unity in pronoun usage, such as consistently using first person or third 
person, provides clarity and coherence. Maintaining unity in tense ensures a smooth, 
logical flow of time throughout the piece, while unity in mood sustains the emotional 
tone, keeping the reader connected to the narrative. Lastly, unity in style, whether 
formal or informal, aligns the writing with the intended audience and purpose, creating 
a cohesive and compelling read.

Alawys collect more material thann you will use. Also don't go on gathering facts forever.
At some point you must stop researching and start writing. 

Always look for ways to convey your information in narrative form. Always give as much
thought to choosing your last sentence as you did to your first. Why didn't you give more
thought to how you were going to wind thisthing up? or are you summarizing because you
think they're too dumb to get the point? A perfect ending should take your readers slightly 
by surprise and yet seem exactly right. the didn't expect the article to end so soon, or
so abruptly, or to say what it said. But they know it when they see it. Like a good lead,
it works. The simplest way of putting this into a rule is: when you are ready to stop,
stop. If you have presented all the facts and made the point you want to make, look for
the nearest exit. 

## Verbs

Use active verbs unless there is no comfortable way to get around using a passive verb.
"Jow saw him" is strong. "He was seen by Joe" is weak. Verbs are the most important of
all your tolls. They push the sentence forward and give it momentum. Active verbs push
hard; passive verbs tug fitfully Active verbs also enable us to visualize an activity
because they require a pronoun (he), or a noun (the boy), or a person (Mrs. Scott) to
put them in motion. 

Make active verbs activate your sentences, and avoid the kind that need an appended
preposition to complete their work. Don't say that the president of the company stepped
down. Did he resign? Did he retire? Did he get fired? Be precise. Use precise verbs. 

## Adverbs 

Most adverbs are unnecessary. You will clutter your sentence and annoy the reader if you
choose a verb that has a specific meaning and then add an adverb that carries the same 
meaning. Again and again in careless writing strong verbs are weakend by redundant adverbs. 

## Adjective 

Most adjectives are also unnecessary. Like adverbs, they are sprinkled into sentences by 
writers who don't stop to thinnk that the concept is already in the noun. The adjective 
that exists solely as decoration is a self-indulgence for the writer and a burden for the
reader. The rule is to keep it to keep it simple. 

## Qualifiers 

Prune out the small words that qualify how you feel and how you think and what you saw; 
'a bit', 'a little', 'sort of', 'kind of', 'very', 'pretty much' etc. They dilute your 
style and your peruasiveness. The main point is one of authority. Every little qualifier
whittles away some fraction of the reader's trust. Readers want a writer who believes in 
himself and in what he is saying. Don't diminish that belief. Don't be kind of bold. Be
bold. 

## Paragraphs 

Keep your paragraphs short. Writing is visual, it catches the eye before it has a chance
to catch the brain. Short paragraphs put air around what you write and make it look inviting, 
whereas a long chunk of type can discourage a reader from even starting to read. Study good 
nonfiction writers to see how they do it. You'll find that almost all of them think in paragraphs
units, not in sentence units. Each paragraph has its own integrity of content and structure. 

## Rewriting 

Rewriting is the essence of writing well; it's where the game is won or lost. This idea is 
hard to accept. We all have an emotional attachment to our first draft; we can't believe 
that it wasn't born perfect. But, the newly hatched sentence almost always has something 
wrong with it. It's not clear. It's not logical. It's verbose. It's pretentious. It's boring. 
It's full of clutter. It's full of cliches. It lacks rhythm. It can be rea in several
different ways. 

The point is that clear writing is the result of a lot of tinkering. Many people assume that 
professional writers don't need to rewrite; the words just fell into place. On the contray, 
careful writers can't stop fiddling. You won't write well until you understand that writing 
is an evolving process, not a finished product.
