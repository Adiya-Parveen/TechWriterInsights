## Writing Guidance 101: Embrace Your Own Method and Daily Practice

Before starting anything new, it is normal to ask for experienced person's adivce. But 
don't ask other writers for a "perfect" or a "right" method to write, because there isn't 
one. There are all kinds of writers and all kind of methods, and any method that helps 
you to say what you want to say is the right method for you.

I sought advice from several seasoned writers, asking for guidance on what steps to take 
and how to approach the situation, and the one thing that was constant in everyone's 
answer was that I should always remember that writing is a craft, not an art. I must 
never runaway from my craft, simply because I am lacking inspiration. And as a 
professional writer, I must establish a daily routine of writing and stick to it. 
So the second advice would be if you want to write as a professional, you need to write 
every single day, just like any other job.

## Rewrite

Now, for the lessons that I learned through my experience and something that no one tells
you as it should come naturally to a teachnical writer, and it will come naturally after 
rewriting your document 4 or 5 times. 

With each rewrite you will learn to strip every sentence to its cleanest components. And 
remove every word that serves no function, every long word that could be a short word, 
every adverb that carries the same meaning that is already in the verb, every passive 
construction that leaves the reader unsure of who is doing what - the thousand and one 
adulterants  that weaken the strength of a sentence, you will learn to backspace them and
will try to always simplify.

While rewritting examine every word you put in your document. You will find a surprising 
number that don't serve any purpose. Always ask yourself questions such as, is every 
word doing any new work? Can any thought be expressed with more economy? Is anything 
pompous or pretentious or faddish? Am I hanging on something useless just because I 
think it's beautiful? Asking these questions will help you to simplify and declutter 
your document.

This rewriting and removing will make your document tighter, stronger, more precise, 
and will eliminate every element that's not doing useful work. 

Another tip to detect the unwanted clutter is to ask yourself What am I trying to say?
Then look at what you have written and ask, Have I said it? Is it clear to someone 
encountering the subject for the first time? Does my document misleads or overshare 
or doesn't deliver what it was supposed to?. Always know the WHY and WHAT of your 
document, this will keep your thinking clear and clear thinking becomes clear writing.

## the Audience

"Who am I writing for?" You are writing for yourself. Don't try to visualize the great
mass audience. There is no such audience - every reader is a different person. Don't
try to guess what sort of thing editors want to publish or what you think the country
is in a mood to read. 

In terms of craft
